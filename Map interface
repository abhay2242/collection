1> Map is a root interface of map hierarchy. It is a collection with mapping.
2> It is a prt of coolection framework available from Java 1.2v
3> If we want to store objects with mapping , it maeas if we want to store (KEY, VALUE) pair table format we must chosse map interface and its implementation classes.
4> Map interface does not maintain insertion order and does not have index.
5> Map interface has a sub interface 
     sortedMap and its has
     sub interface NavigabelMap
6> Sortedmap interface is for storing entire on keys based sorting oder. It is also available from Java 1.2V
7> NavigableMap is given in Java 6v , for adding more naviagtin methods to SortedMap.
8> Map interface has 7 implementation classes
     5 are CsF classes and 2 are lagecy classes
     HashMap, LinkedHashMap, EnumMap, WeakHashMap, IdentityHashMap, Hashtable, Properties.
     SortedMap and NavigableMap has only one implementation class TreeMap.

HashMap -> 

1) HashMap is an Collection FrameWork collection.
      it  is avalable from Java 1.2V
      It is implementation of Map interface.

    -> when we want to store objects with mapping with unique keys in single thread appliction or in method local operation     
       without worrying insertion order we must choose HashMap.

2) It is non syncronized means not thread safe objects.
3) It  is unordered collection -> does not maintian the insertion order.
4) Its implementation data structure is hashtable.
5) Its default capacity is 16
     incremeantal capacity is double or +1
     load factor is 0.75 or 75%
6) It allows us to store 
      as keys -> only 3 types of objects [ Homogenous , Heterogenous and uniqu] 
      as value -> all 4 types of objects [ Homogenous, Heterogenous, Unique and Duplicate]

    HashMap by default can stop only refrence wise duplicates keys, 
    If we want stop data wise duplicates, we must override both hashcode() and equals() method in our class, else data wise
     duplicates keys are stored in collection.
