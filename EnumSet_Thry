EnumSet is an collection framework collection 
     -> It is available from Java 5v
     -> It is an implementation of set interface 
   *-> When we need to store one particular enum named constant as one group we use enumset.
     -> It is not syncronined means it is not thread safe.
  * -> It is an ordered collection
           it store names constants in the order exactly they are declared in enum.
  * -> The internal data structure is fixed array
  * -> The length is enum size, means number of named constants.
     -> It allow us to store only the given name constants.
  * -> It does not allow null.
     -> In adding searching and removing opertions, internally 
      equals() method is called and those executed from enum.
